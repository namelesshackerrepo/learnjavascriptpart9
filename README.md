# Learn JavaScript part 9, intro to arrays

As always, this is a lesson in ignoring complexity.  
You don't have to know exactly how everything works in order
to complete the code.  

There is only one line of code that needs to be fixed so that the app will work.  

Look inside the for looop in the displayData function.  You'll need to access the 
first name, last name, relationship and age from each subarray.  

This is first time localStorage is introduced.  
localStorage exist on the browser and can be used to store data.  This data will persist 
through a refresh.  

Open the chrome dev tools, under application, click on localStorage.  It's a like  a mini data base
that exist on your computer only.
